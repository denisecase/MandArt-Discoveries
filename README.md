## MandArt Discoveries

The Mandelbrot set has been called one of "the most complex objects" known. 
We could look forever and stil find new things. 

Use the following site to explore some of the interesting patterns discovered so far.
You can use this site to download the examples, color them as you like, 
or use them to start new journeys.
If you make a new discovery or create custom art, we'd love to see it!
